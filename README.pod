=head1 NAME

Net::DNS::Abstract - Net::DNS interface to several DNS backends via API

=head1 VERSION

version 0.5

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Net::DNS is the de-facto standard and battle tested perl DNS
implementation. Unfortunately we don't intercat with DNS via DNS
protocols but via 3rd party abstration layers that have all sorts of
quirks. We try to provide one unified interface here.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 axfr

Do a zone transfer (actually poll a zone from a 3rd party provider) and
return a list of Net::DNS::RR objects. Additional to a list of nameservers
we need a backend identifyer that we have a API plugin for.

    axfr({ 
        domain => 'example.com', 
        interface => 'InternetX', 
        ns => ['ns1.provider.net']
    })

=head2 update

Update a DNS zone via the respective backend plugin. This function takes
a Net::DNS update object and pushes it through to the backend plugin to
process it.

=head2 create

Create a new zone in a DNS backend

=head2 delete

Delete a zone from a DNS backend

=head2 to_net_dns

Converts a zone from our generic representation to Net::DNS format.

=head2 add_rr

Adds a RR hash to a Net::DNS object. Also converts our standardized hash
into a Net::DNS::RR object.

=head2 rr_from_hash

Create a Net::DNS::RR object from a hash

=head2 from_net_dns

Convert a Net::DNS object into our normalized format

=head2 to_string

Stringify a Net::DNS object

=head2 load_plugin

Loads a Plugin for Net::DNS::Abstract

=head2 register

Registers a plugin in the internal registry (with all the callbacks we
need for dispatching).
